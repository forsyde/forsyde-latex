\section{The \texttt{forsyde-tikz} package}


This library is used to draw \ForSyDe\ systems modeled as process networks. The package is imported using the command \texttt{\char`\\usepackage[tikz]\{forsyde\}} in the document preamble.

A \ForSyDe\ process network is drawn inside a \texttt{tikzpicture} environment, like any other \textsc{TikZ} figure. The \texttt{options} provided are key variables defined by the \texttt{tikz} package. \bookmark{environment}

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[options]
    content...
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{verbatim}

Apart from the standard keys, \texttt{forsyde-tikz} provides the following \texttt{options} variables:\bookmark{environment variables}
\begin{optionslist}
\item \texttt{no moc color} : disables process coloring according to their MoC.
\item \texttt{no moc label} : disables process labeling according to their MoC.
\item \texttt{label style=} : font style for the process type labels. Default is \texttt{\char`\\ textbf}.
\item \texttt{type style=} : font style for the process name labels. Default is \texttt{\char`\\ scriptsize\char`\\textit}.
\item \texttt{function style=} : font style for the functions. Default is \texttt{\char`\\ scriptsize}.
\item \texttt{constructors=[shallow|atom]} : switches between the process constructor naming convention of either \ForSyDeShallow\ or \ForSyDeAtom. Default is \texttt{atom}.
\end{optionslist}

\subsection{Main nodes}

Process networks are drawn using a combination of commands and style options for customizing shapes. 

\subsubsection{Draw commands}
\label{sec:draw-commands}

Inside the \texttt{tikzpicture} environment, one can use a set of draw commands\footnote{All draw commands are defined in the \texttt{forsyde.nodes} \textsc{TikZ} library, which is loaded by default by the \texttt{forsyde-tikz} package, but can also be loaded independently using the command \texttt{\string\usetikzlibrary\{forsyde.nodes\}} in the document preamble.} which are used as templates for placing shapes and information provided as arguments. In the following listing, the \opt{gray}\man{} arguments are optional while the \man{black} ones are mandatory. 
The library also provide as set of helper styles for setting several options at once, presented in \ref{sec:helper-options}.


\begin{figure}[htb]\centering
\includegraphics{figs/example-node-basic}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={8-8}]{figs_src/example-node-basic.tex}

\end{figure}
\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\basic\opt{[options]}\opt{(name)}\opt{<position>}\man{\{label\}};}

\noindent The basic node is the simplest depiction of a function (e.g., process, atom) with maximum one argument. It is the most lightweight graphical primitive, and does not contain port anchors. It can be customized with the following keys (check \ref{sec:helper-options} for composite options):

\begin{optionslist}

\noindent The standard node is a more complex depiction of a ForSyDe block. It contains anchors for each port, shows a label and the constructor name, and its field is colored according to a MoC (if this is the case). It can be customized with the following keys (check \ref{sec:helper-options} for composite options):

\end{figure}
\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\interface\opt{[options]}\opt{(name)}\opt{<position>}\man{\{domain~left\}}\man{\{domain~right\}};}

\end{figure}
\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\trans\opt{[options]}\opt{(name)}\opt{<position>}\man{\{\}};}

\noindent This command draws a transversal node over a path (usually 90 degrees), which symbolizes a structural transition of the path's type (e.g. permutation). The label is ignored, but the brackets are necessary to mark the end of the arguments. It can be customized with the following keys (check \ref{sec:helper-options} for composite options):

\begin{optionslist}

\end{figure}
\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\cluster\opt{[options]}\opt{(name)}\man{<list~of~clustered~nodes>}\man{\{label\}};}

\noindent This command draws a cluster around other nodes. Instead of a position, it requires a list of nodes to fit. Apart from the functions and port anchors as seen in the previous commands, this command provides the edges of the outer shape cluster as names.

\subsubsection{Helper options}
\label{sec:helper-options}

\bookmark{node helper keys}
The \texttt{forsyde-tikz} library provides a large set of styles or function keys\footnote{The helpers are defined in the \texttt{forsyde-tikz} package itself, separated from the \textsc{TikZ} libraries.} that can be used for user convenience as options in the draw commands shown in section \ref{sec:draw-commands}. 

\begin{longtable} { r|p{11cm} }
  \toprule
  \textbf{Key}  & \textbf{Description/Expands to}  \\

\subsection{Paths}

Data flow in \texttt{forsyde-tikz} is represented as (directed) edges between components. These are regular \textsc{TikZ} paths\footnote{All paths are defined in the \texttt{forsyde.paths} \textsc{TikZ} library, which is loaded by default by the \texttt{forsyde-tikz} package, but can also be loaded independently using the command \texttt{\string\usetikzlibrary\{forsyde.paths\}} in the document preamble.}, customized with a series of keys provided by the library. There are obvious advantages for using the \textsc{TikZ} infrastructure, such as being able to further customize paths outside the scope of this library, or reuse existing keys (e.g. the arrow tips, shapes). The custom port or function anchors presented in the previous section come in handy when considering port-to-port connections. 


\begin{figure}[htb]\centering
\includegraphics{figs/example-paths}
\lstinputlisting[linerange={9-19}]{figs_src/example-paths.tex}
\caption{Different paths created with the library provided styles}
\end{figure}

The library provides the following custom keys:\bookmark{path keys}

\begin{optionslist}
\item \texttt{s=[MoC]} draws a signal. If the global options allow it, passing a MoC string to this key will color the signal accordingly. 
\item \texttt{sn=[MoC]} draws an n-tuple of signals. If the global options allow it, passing a MoC string to this key will color the signal accordingly. 
\item \texttt{v=[MoC]} draws a vector. If the global options allow it, passing a MoC string to this key will color the vector accordingly, suggesting that it contains signals of their respective MoC.
\item \texttt{vn=[MoC]} draws an n-tuple of vectors. If the global options allow it, passing a MoC string to this key will color the vector accordingly, suggesting that it contains signals of their respective MoC.
\item \texttt{f} draws an edge used for showing how arguments of a higher order function or a hierarchical block are further passed to its components.  
\item \texttt{fn} similar to \texttt{f}, but for n-tuples of functions.  
\item \texttt{srcport} draws a port symbol at the source of the path.
\item \texttt{dstport} draws a port symbol at the destination of the path.
\item \texttt{token=[token-string]} draws symbols for depicting the data structures carried by \ForSyDe\ signals or vectors. The accepted tokens strings are \texttt{scalar|vector|function}. To draw tuple structures you have to separate token keywords by \texttt{-} (dash). E.g.: 3-tuple of scalar,  vector and function can be drawn with \texttt{token=scalar-vector-function}. To depict functions which take other data types as arguments, you can group some tokens between parentheses. E.g. a 2-tuple of a scalar and a function which takes a vector and a scalar as arguments can be drawn with \texttt{token=scalar-(vector-scalar)}.
\item \texttt{token pos=[0.0 .. 1.0]} the position between the start node/anchor and the end node/anchor of the token symbols' center position. Default is \texttt{0.5}.
\item \texttt{intersect=[path-name]} finds the first intersection with the path named \texttt{[path-name]}, and creates a coordinate from it, named by default \texttt{int} if no other name was given with the \texttt{as} key.
\item \texttt{as=[coordinate-name]} names the intersection coordinate found with the \texttt{intersect}.
\item \texttt{trans=\{source-path-style\}\{intersection-path-name\}\{destination-path-style\}} is a helper key which finds the intersection of the current path with \texttt{intersection-path-name}, splits the current path into two, decorated with \texttt{source-path-style} and  \texttt{destination-path-style} respectively.
\item \texttt{-|-=[0.0..1.0]} will create a horizontal-vertical-horizontal spline in the path. It may be accompanied by a number which determines the position of the 90 degree angle.
\item \texttt{|-|=[0.0..1.0]} will create a vertical-horizontal-vertical spline in the path. It may be accompanied by a number which determines the position of the 90 degree angle.
\item \texttt{-|-=[0.0..1.0]} will create a horizontal-vertical-horizontal spline in the path. It may be accompanied by a number which determines the position of the 90 degree angle.
\item \texttt{-|-|=[0.0..1.0]} will create a horizontal-vertical-horizontal-vertical spline in the path. It may be accompanied by a number which determines the position of the 90 degree angle.
\item \texttt{-|-|-=[0.0..1.0]:[0.0..1.0]} will create a horizontal-vertical-horizontal-vertical-horizontal spline in the path. It may be accompanied by two numbers  separated by \texttt{:} which determine the position of the 90 degree angles.
\item \texttt{|-|-|=[0.0..1.0]:[0.0..1.0]} will create a vertical-horizontal-vertical-horizontal-vertical spline in the path. It may be accompanied by two numbers  separated by \texttt{:} which determine the position of the 90 degree angles.
\item \texttt{deviate=} is a length representing the deviation from the straight path in case of complex splines (\texttt{-|-|},\texttt{-|-|-} and \texttt{|-|-|}).
\end{optionslist}

\subsubsection{Helper commands}
\label{sec:helper-commands}

The following commands can be alternatively used to draw paths, in case the complexity of the \texttt{\string\path} \textsc{TikZ} command is not needed. The MoC can be passed to the \texttt{moc} style key.\\

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\signal\man[style]~\man(from)~arrow-tip~(to)};}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\signaln\man[style]~\man(from)~arrow-tip~(to)};}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\vector\man[style]~\man(from)~arrow-tip~(to)};}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\vectorn\man[style]~\man(from)~arrow-tip~(to)};}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\function\man[style]~\man(from)~arrow-tip~(to)};}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\functionn\man[style]~\man(from)~arrow-tip~(to)};}\\\\

\subsection{Utility commands}

Following is a list of miscellaneous functions and environments provided for user convenience:\\

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\textleftof\{node\}\{text\}}}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\textrightof\{node\}\{text\}}}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\textaboveof\{node\}\{text\}}}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\textbelowof\{node\}\{text\}}}

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\texttt{\string\ifnodedefined\{node\}\{true~expr\}\{false~expr\}}}\\

\noindent Conditional sub-drawing if a node has been defined or not. Useful for ignoring edge cases when drawing recursive structures with \texttt{\string\foreach}.

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\gettikzx\man\{node\}\{\char`\\xmacro\}}

\noindent Gets the \texttt{X} coordinate of \texttt{node} and stores it in \texttt{\string\xmacro}.

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\gettikzy\man\{node\}\{\char`\\ymacro\}}

\noindent Gets the \texttt{Y} coordinate of \texttt{node} and stores it in \texttt{\string\ymacro}.

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\gettikzxy\man\{node\}\{\char`\\xmacro\}\{\char`\\ymacro\}}

\noindent Gets the \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y} coordinates of \texttt{node} and stores them in \texttt{\string\xmacro} and  \texttt{\string\ymacro} respectively.

\end{figure}
\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\resetportinfo\man\{node\}}

\noindent Resets the counters for the \texttt{\string\epinfo} and \texttt{\string\wpinfo} commands which decorates ports with information. These commands can be used for decorating ports, for example, with production and consumption rates in case of SDF processes.

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\wpinfo\opt[anchor]\man\{label\}}

\noindent Places a label node next to a western port and increases its counter.

\hspace{1pt}\bookmark{\char`\\epinfo\opt[anchor]\man\{label\}}

\noindent Places a label node next to a eastern port and increases its counter.

\subsection{Further customizing the environment}

The following commands can be used in the document preamble for changing environment variables.
