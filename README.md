# ForSyDe group main web page

This repo holds the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template for the FOrSyDe-LaTeX project web pages hosted at [forsyde.github.io/forsyde-latex](forsyde.github.io/forsyde-latex). Follow the instructions below if you want to contribute or do modifications.

## Contributing to the site

Here is how you can contribute to this site:

### Adding/editing web pages

The templates for generating web pages are found in `/index.md` and `/pages/*`. They can be in any format among Markdown, Texify or plain HTML, and might contain [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) template syntax. When writing a new page, do not forget the [Jekyll preamble](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) especially the `permalink` and `layout` variables. Check existing pages for tips, and the [forsyde-web-theme documentation](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-web-theme/blob/master/docs/README.md) for a list of all variables. Also, the [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-web-theme/blob/master/index.md) might also come in handy.

Do not modify anything in `/pages/news/*` or `/pages/publications/*` since they are generated by scripts generated. 

### Adding static resources

Static resources are found in `assets`, under their appropriate folder. E.g. images should be added under `assets/images/` folder. 

Do not touch `assets/svg/*` nor `assets/pdf/*` as they are generated from scripts.

### Adding site-wide styles

CSS styles which are active on this site alone (they are ignored on project sites), can be added in `assets/css/style.scss`. 

### Adding code examples

The examples page are generated from the TeX files found the `master` branch, in the folders `/doc/figs_src` and `/examples`. So if you want to add pages with examples

 1. add the code in the appropriate place (ideally `examples` in master)
 1. make sure the code compiles right
 1. push the the example file(s) to master
 1. switch to this branch `gh-pages`, and run the script:
     
	 cd scripts
	 ./make-examples

## Verifying if the site builds

The site at https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-latex is re-generated every time someone pushes to the `gh-pages` branch. This means that it would be wise to render it locally and verify it on `localhost:4000` before any changes are commited publicly.

First you need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and other dependencies. On Ubuntu, you would do

    # install make and gcc
    sudo apt install build-essential
	
	# install Ruby
	sudo apt install ruby-all-dev
	
	# build Jekyll
	sudo gem install jekyll bundler
	
	# set up this site
	cd path/to/this/repo
    bundle install

In order to start the preview server, run

    bundle exec jekyll serve
	
Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme.
